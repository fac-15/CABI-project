#### User stories 

1. As a user, I want to be able to choose my location

2. As a user, I want to be able to choose a crop and see info about the crop-specific pests

3. As a user, I want to be able to choose a pest and see information about that specific pest

4. As a user, I want to be able to visualise a summary of all the crops and pests available for my area
